# Deep Thought

A Clojure library to perform Deep Learning.

## Requirements
[core.matrix](https://clojars.org/net.mikera/core.matrix)
[incanter](https://github.com/incanter/incanter)

## Usage

Still very much a work in progress. The idea is to recreate a Deep Learning algorithm in Clojure. I'll be creating the components from research into existing implementation including Theano.
